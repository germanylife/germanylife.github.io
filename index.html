<div class="privacy-policy">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes how we process personal data of users of the mobile application "Germany Life" (the "App"). This document has been prepared in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the German data protection laws.</p>
    <p>The "Germany Life" app is an educational and informational resource for immigrants and residents of Germany, providing information on the "Leben in Deutschland" and "Einbürgerungstest" exams, tips for adaptation, waste sorting, useful phrases, and directories of banks and services, among others. The app is developed by an independent developer and is not affiliated with any government bodies in Germany.</p>
    <p>By using the App, the user agrees to the terms of this Policy. If the user does not agree with the terms, they should discontinue using the App.</p>

    <h2>Collection and Use of Personal Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Collection when Using the App.</strong> At the moment, using "Germany Life" does not require registration or the provision of any personal data. The app does not request personal information such as your name, address, or date of birth, nor does it collect such data automatically when used normally.</p>
    <p><strong>No Sensitive Data Collection.</strong> The app also does not request access to sensitive data on the user's device (e.g., contacts, photos, or geolocation) and does not receive such data without explicit permission. All features of the app are provided without the need to enter personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>User Inquiries.</strong> If a user voluntarily contacts the developer of the App (e.g., by email for support or feedback), such communication may contain personal data (e.g., email address or name). This information will only be used to respond to the inquiry and will not be shared with third parties, except as required by law.</p>
    <p><strong>Future Changes in Data Collection.</strong> If new features or services are added to the App that involve the input or processing of personal data (e.g., creating an account, personalized settings, etc.), we will notify users in advance and update this Privacy Policy accordingly. Any future processing of personal data will be carried out based on legal grounds (such as user consent or legitimate interests) and in strict compliance with GDPR.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services and Analytics</h2>
    <p><strong>Use of Analytics Services.</strong> Currently, the App does not integrate third-party analytics tools or trackers. However, in the future, we may integrate analytics services, such as Google Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics, to improve the quality of the service. These services help track how users interact with the App and collect technical and statistical information.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Data Collected by Analytics.</strong> The possible data collected by the analytics services includes: device information (model, OS version, language settings), usage data (e.g., session frequency and duration, sections viewed, interactions with specific features), and general geographic region (e.g., country or city). Analytics tools may also collect anonymized identifiers, such as device unique IDs or advertising IDs (IDFA on iOS, GAID on Android), which are used to distinguish unique users. These data are collected in anonymized form and do not allow the identification of the user.</p>
    <p><strong>Purpose of Analytics.</strong> The collected statistical data will be used exclusively to improve the App, identify the most useful features, fix errors (e.g., through crash reports), and generally analyze the user experience. We will not use these data for any purposes other than improving the App.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Analytics Data Recipients.</strong> If analytics services are integrated, some data on the user's interaction with the App may be transferred to third-party providers (e.g., Google). These providers act as data processors on our behalf and are obliged to process the data only to provide us with aggregated analytical information. We will carefully choose providers that comply with GDPR requirements. However, such companies (e.g., Google) may process the collected data on their servers, which may be located outside the European Economic Area. In case of cross-border data transfers, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., based on EU standard contractual clauses or other lawful mechanisms).</p>
    <p><strong>Opting Out of Analytics.</strong> If analytics services are implemented in the future, users may be given the option to opt out of data collection (e.g., through settings in the App or device settings). We will seek users' necessary consent for the collection of analytics data if required by applicable laws, or we will rely on our legitimate interest while respecting the rights and freedoms of the user.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and Monetization</h2>
    <p><strong>Planned Monetization via Ads.</strong> In the future, we may introduce advertisements to monetize the App. These ads will likely be provided through third-party ad networks (e.g., via SDKs like Google AdMob or similar platforms). When showing ads, these third-party services may automatically collect certain data about the device and user behavior.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Collected by Ad Partners.</strong> If ad SDKs are integrated, they may access data such as device identifiers or advertising IDs (IDFA on iOS, GAID on Android), session information, general location data (e.g., up to the city or region level, but not exact addresses), and information about interactions with ads (e.g., ad views or clicks). This data is used by ad networks to display relevant (including personalized) ads and track ad performance. Generally, this data does not include personally identifiable information such as names or contact details, but the advertising ID may be considered personal data under GDPR.</p>
    <p><strong>Personalized Ads and Consent.</strong> Before launching personalized (targeted) ads, we will ensure compliance with privacy laws. Specifically, if required, we will seek explicit user consent for processing data for advertising purposes (e.g., through a pop-up consent dialog for personalized ads). Users will have the option to withdraw their consent, after which they will be shown contextual or less relevant ads that are not based on their preferences. Users will also be able to change their decision regarding ad personalization in the App's settings (if implemented) or by using device privacy settings (e.g., enabling "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt-out of Personalized Ads" on Android).</p>
    <p><strong>Ad Partners' Privacy Policies.</strong> Please note that when ads are shown, data about the user may be directly collected by third-party ad partners. These companies are independent data controllers, and their use of information is governed by their own privacy policies. We will carefully choose ad networks that comply with GDPR requirements and ensure secure data processing. However, we do not control the activities of such third parties and are not responsible for their actions. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of the relevant ad provider when ads appear in the App.</p>
    <p><strong>Ad Networks and Third-Party Services.</strong> The App may include third-party content, such as ads and analytics services, that may collect data directly from users. These companies are independent data controllers, and their use of information is governed by their own privacy policies. We do not control the activities of third-party services and are not responsible for their actions. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the relevant third-party service providers (such as advertising networks, analytics platforms, etc.) to understand how their data is collected, processed, and used.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share users' personal data with third parties for commercial purposes. The processing of any personal data is strictly limited to the purposes outlined in this Policy and may include sharing data with a limited number of recipients in the following cases:</p>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> If we engage third-party companies to process data on our behalf (e.g., hosting providers, email notification services, or analytics), these companies operate under contracts and are required to process data only according to our instructions and in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws. They are not authorized to use the data for their own purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Ad Networks.</strong> In the case of showing ads, certain data, as described above, may be directly collected by advertising partners for displaying ads. These partners are independent data controllers and are responsible for processing the data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal Requirements.</strong> We may disclose user information if required by applicable law, a court order, or an official request from an authorized government body. In such cases, data will be provided strictly to the extent necessary to comply with the legal obligation.</p>
    <p><strong>Change of Ownership.</strong> In the event of reorganization, merger, or sale of our app to another owner, user personal data (if any) may be transferred to the new owner along with the relevant assets. In such cases, we will ensure that the new owner assumes the same privacy obligations at least to the level outlined in this Policy and notify users if their personal data will be affected.</p>
    <p>In all cases of data sharing with third parties, we comply with applicable GDPR requirements, including ensuring appropriate legal grounds and protective measures (e.g., entering into data protection agreements and using standard contractual clauses for cross-border data transfers).</p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We take necessary technical and organizational measures to protect any information related to users. Specifically:</p>
    <p>All connections to servers (e.g., when sending statistics or downloading content) are secured using encryption (HTTPS protocol) to prevent unauthorized access or interception of data.</p>
    <p>If any personal data is stored on our servers or those of third-party providers in the future, we will apply industry-standard security measures, including data encryption, firewall protection, and access control based on need-to-know principles.</p>
    <p>We regularly update the App and the server components to address any identified vulnerabilities and ensure that security measures remain up-to-date.</p>
    <p>Access to any personal data within our organization (if any data is collected in the future) will be restricted to those employees or contractors who need it to perform their job functions, and they will be bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>
    <p>Despite our efforts, no method of data transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. We strive to protect your information, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the event of a data breach or unauthorized access to personal data, we will take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and notify affected users and supervisory authorities (if required) in accordance with the law.</p>

    <h2>Users' Rights</h2>
    <p>Users located in the EU have the following rights with respect to their personal data under GDPR:</p>
    <p><strong>Right of Access.</strong> The user has the right to request confirmation of whether their personal data is being processed and to obtain a copy of this data, as well as information about the purposes of processing, the categories of data, and the recipients of the data.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Rectification.</strong> The user can request the correction of inaccurate or outdated personal data that concerns them.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten").</strong> In certain cases, the user has the right to request the deletion of their personal data, for example, if the data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, or if the user has withdrawn their consent, and there are no other legal grounds for processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> The user has the right, in certain circumstances, to request the temporary suspension of processing their data (except for storage) – for example, if the accuracy of the data is disputed or if the user objects to processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Object.</strong> The user may object to the processing of their personal data if it is carried out based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. If an objection is made, we will cease processing the data unless we can provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the user's interests and rights.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Data Portability.</strong> In certain cases, the user has the right to receive the personal data provided to us in a structured, machine-readable format and/or request the direct transfer of this data to another data controller, if technically feasible.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent.</strong> If the processing of personal data is based on the user's consent, they have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint.</strong> The user has the right to file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority for data protection in their country of residence or where the alleged violation occurred. In Germany, the relevant authority is the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI) or the relevant state authority for data protection.</p>
    <p>We ensure that users can exercise their rights regarding personal data that we process. Since the App currently does not process personal data, the implementation of some of the listed rights may be limited by the inability to identify users in our systems. Nevertheless, if you have any questions or requests related to your personal data or the exercise of your rights, you can contact us using the details below. We will consider each request and respond within the legally prescribed timeframe.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to external websites or third-party resources (e.g., official informational portals). When you click on such links, you leave the App. This Privacy Policy does not apply to external websites or services.</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party websites linked from the App. Users are advised to review the privacy policy and terms of use of any third-party resources they visit via external links to understand how their data is collected and used. Data provided to third-party websites is done at the user's own risk and responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect or request personal data from children under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not provide any personal data through the App.</p>
    <p>Parents and legal guardians are encouraged to monitor children's use of mobile apps. If we become aware that personal data from children under the age of 16 has been unintentionally collected, we will promptly delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your minor child has used the App and provided us with any data, please contact us so we can delete the relevant information.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Informational Nature of Content.</strong> All materials provided in the "Germany Life" App are for informational purposes only. We make efforts to keep the information provided accurate and up to date, but we do not guarantee that all content in the App is entirely accurate or error-free. For example, exam questions and answers ("Leben in Deutschland", "Einbürgerungstest", etc.), tips, translations, and reference data may become outdated or contain inaccuracies. The App is not an official source of information, and none of the information in it should be considered legally binding or equivalent to official consultations from governmental bodies.</p>
    <p><strong>No Affiliation with Government Agencies.</strong> The App is developed by an independent enthusiast/developer and is not sanctioned or endorsed by any government organizations in Germany. The App may use publicly available information, including data from official websites (e.g., materials from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees - BAMF), which are translated or adapted for the convenience of users. However, "Germany Life" is not an official BAMF app or affiliated with any government institutions, and we do not guarantee full accuracy or timeliness of such materials compared to official sources.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsibility for Using Information.</strong> The user is solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and applicability of information obtained through the App before relying on it. Any actions taken by the user based on information from the App (including exam preparation or document processing) are done at their own discretion and risk. We strongly recommend cross-checking important information with official sources or consulting with professionals. The developer of the App is not responsible for any losses or negative consequences arising from the use of information obtained through the App.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Libraries and Components.</strong> The App may use third-party software components (e.g., analytics libraries or advertising modules) developed by third parties. We strive to use only trusted and reliable solutions, but we cannot fully control their operation. The App developer is not responsible for any errors, malfunctions, or security vulnerabilities caused by the operation of third-party components. Data processing by such components is carried out in accordance with their own rules and agreements. If third-party libraries or services (such as analytics or ads) collect or use any data, this is done as described in this Policy, and such third parties are solely responsible for fulfilling their privacy obligations.</p>

    <p><strong>AI-Generated Content.</strong> Portions of the content in the "Germany Life" App, including translations, explanations, exam answers, and other informational materials, may be created using artificial intelligence or neural networks. While we strive for accuracy and quality, AI-generated materials may contain errors, misinterpretations, or outdated information. We make no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of such AI-generated content. Users should verify important information from official sources before relying on it. While we strive to ensure that all content, including AI-generated content, is accurate and respectful, we do not guarantee that it is free from unintended biases, discriminatory remarks, or offensive content. We do not assume responsibility for any content that may unintentionally contain biases, discriminatory remarks, or offensive material. If any user encounters such content, we encourage them to contact us immediately.</p>
    <p><strong>No Legal, Financial, or Professional Advice.</strong> The information provided in the "Germany Life" App, including guides related to immigration processes, residence permits, citizenship applications, and similar topics, does not constitute legal, financial, or professional advice. This App is designed to provide general information for educational purposes only. Users should always consult with qualified professionals (such as immigration lawyers, financial advisors, or authorized government representatives) before making important decisions or taking actions based on information from this App. Immigration laws, regulations, and administrative procedures are complex and subject to change, and individual circumstances may require specialized advice.</p>
    <p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer of "Germany Life" shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from: (1) your use of or inability to use the App; (2) any inaccuracies, errors, or omissions in the content (whether created manually or by AI systems); (3) decisions made or actions taken based on information obtained through the App; (4) unauthorized access to or alteration of your data; (5) the actions or omissions of third-party services, ad partners, or external content providers; or (6) any damages resulting from interactions with third-party content or external links.</p>
    <p><strong>User Responsibility for Decisions.</strong> Users acknowledge and agree that they are solely responsible for any decision made or action taken based on information obtained through the App. This includes, but is not limited to, decisions related to immigration, legal compliance, examination preparation, cultural adaptation, or any other matter addressed in the App's content. The App is intended to provide general guidance and information only, and users rely on such information at their own risk. We strongly encourage users to consult qualified professionals for any actions or decisions that may have significant legal, financial, or personal consequences.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p><strong>Ownership of Content.</strong> Unless otherwise stated, the developer of "Germany Life" owns or has properly licensed all intellectual property rights in the App and its content. This includes but is not limited to the App's structure, design, compilations, text, graphics, user interfaces, and the selection and arrangement of content.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Content.</strong> The App may include content derived from public sources, such as official German government publications, examination materials, or public information. Such content remains the property of its respective owners, and its inclusion in the App is not intended to claim ownership of such material.</p>
    <p><strong>User License.</strong> Users are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App's content for personal, non-commercial purposes. Users may not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, or publicly perform any content from the App without prior written permission from the App developer, except as permitted by applicable law.</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback and Suggestions.</strong> If users provide feedback, ideas, or suggestions regarding the App ("Feedback"), they agree that: (1) the Feedback becomes the property of the App developer; (2) the App developer owes no confidentiality obligation regarding the Feedback; (3) the App developer may use or disclose the Feedback for any purpose without compensation or attribution.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version of the Policy will become effective once it is published in the App or on the official website (if applicable), unless otherwise specified in the updated version of the Policy. Please review the "Privacy Policy" section of the App regularly to track any changes.</p>
    <p>In the event of significant changes to the rules for processing personal data (e.g., beginning to collect new types of data or transferring data to new categories of recipients), we will make efforts to notify users of such changes. Notification may be made through a prominent announcement in the App, via a pop-up window, or by other available means. If we have a user's contact email (provided earlier, e.g., for support), we may also send a notification via email. Continuing to use the App after the updated Policy becomes effective will indicate your consent to the new terms.</p>
